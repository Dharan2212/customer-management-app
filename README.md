# Customer Management App

A basic customer management web application that allows users to log in, view a list of customers, create new customers, update existing customer details, and delete customers. The application is integrated with APIs for authentication and CRUD operations on customer data.

## Description

The Customer Management App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a Node.js backend for handling API requests. It follows a simple design with separate HTML files for each screen, including the login screen, customer list screen, create/update customer screen, and delete customer screen. The app uses Bearer authentication to secure API calls.

## Guidelines

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Implement the actual API calls in the JavaScript files for each screen.
5. Replace the placeholders (YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN, fetchCustomerByUUID, etc.) with actual values and implementations.
6. Run the server with `node server.js`.
7. Access the app in the browser at http://localhost:3000.
8. Use Postman to test the APIs.
